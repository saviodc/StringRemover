# String Remover
## Description
This is a simple string remover that removes pesky substrings and provides the code as one string for you to use. Great to use when adding multiple files on git after you read the status, but do not want to type out directories manually

## How to use
1. Run the main
2. Type in the substring you want to be removed from the rest of the input
3. Keep adding input
4. Once complete use EOF (Ctr+D || Cmd+D)

This will give you the input as one, space-separated, string.
